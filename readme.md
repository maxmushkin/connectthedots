The Smart Building Preconfigured Solution (PCS) prototype is intended as a proof of concept showing end-to-end functionality 
for a simple Energy Management/Fault Detection system for buildings.

The project is being developed by the Applied Innovation team in Microsoft Services with the assistance of CBRE and DB Engineering, and in collaboration 
with the Azure IoT product group.
